# OpenGL-Water-More
A program with a 2D water shader shown in an OpenGL program, which I put together. I also added some nice twinkling stars, a boat, some fish, and some bubbles floating from the bottom of the screen that avoid the boat. There is also a bgm which I created using Audiosauna.com. The most recent version of this song which sounds much better can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/argzero/drip-drip-drop.


DO NOTE: This repo does not have the most recent build of this in which the interactions with the bubble-like objects has changed. Also, the boat in the new version moves with the water. I will try to get to updating this as soon as I have the time.
