# OpenGL-Water-More
A build of 2D water shaders shown in an OpenGL program I built. I also added some nice twinkling stars, a boat, some fish, and some... things (dunno what to call them really)... floating from the bottom of the screen that avoid the boat.


DO NOTE: This repo does not have the most recent build of this in which the interactions with the bubble-like objects has changed. Also, the boat in the new version moves with the water. I will try to get to updating this as soon as I have the time.
